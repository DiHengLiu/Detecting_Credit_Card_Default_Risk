# Detecting_Credit_Card_Default_Risk
This study performs several data mining algorithms on a UCI Machine Learning Repository dataset to evaluate an optimal model for predicting credit card payment default. The dataset segments customers' credit card accounts as risky or non-risky based on the amount of the given credit, gender, education, marital status, age, history of past payment, amount of bill statement, and amount of previous payment. The algorithms utilize the 24 features to produce the optimal model based on performance metrics. When a customer is classified to be risky, creditors and lenders can take further actions to investigate the actual personal conditions of the customer and hence take preventive actions. However, when a credit cardholder is incorrectly classified to default, or to be in good status when he/she is due to default, revenue is lost by the creditors and lenders. Therefore, we demonstrate ways of mitigating such risks with data mining techniques to predict customer defaults based on historical data from client observations. If the target label Y is 1, then the account will be treated as non-credible.
